def process_data_with_openai(user_query, data):
    """
    Processes the user's query in conjunction with the dataset using the OpenAI API 
    to return the most relevant records, formatted directly by the API.

    This function takes a user's query and a dataset, constructs a prompt to feed 
    into the OpenAI API, and retrieves the most relevant records based on the user's request. 
    The results are returned in a specific format dictated by the prompt.

    Args:
        user_query (str): The query text provided by the user.
        data (list): The dataset fetched from the database, typically a list of tuples or dictionaries.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted response from the OpenAI API, containing the most relevant records.
